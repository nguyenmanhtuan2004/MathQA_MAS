      "context": "Grocery & Snacks net sales for fiscal 2018 were $3.29 billion, an increase of $78.2 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results reflected a decrease in volumes of approximately 2% in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior-year period, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The decrease in sales volumes reflected a reduction in promotional intensity, planned discontinuation of certain lower-performing products, retailer inventory reductions, which were higher than anticipated, and deliberate actions to optimize distribution on certain lower-margin products, consistent with the Company's value over volume strategy. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior-year period as favorable mix improvements from recent innovation and higher net pricing nearly offset continued investments in retailer marketing to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $68.1 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2018. The Frontera acquisition contributed $8.6 million and the Thanasi acquisition contributed $66.5 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2018 through the one-year anniversaries of the acquisitions. The Frontera and Thanasi acquisitions occurred in September 2016 and April 2017, respectively.\n\n| ($ in millions) |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Reporting Segment | Fiscal 2018 Net Sales | Fiscal 2017 Net Sales | % Inc (Dec) |\n| Grocery & Snacks | $3,287.0 | $3,208.8 | 2% |\n| Refrigerated & Frozen | 2,753.0 | 2,652.7 | 4% |\n| International | 843.5 | 816.0 | 3% |\n| Foodservice | 1,054.8 | 1,078.3 | (2)% |\n| Commercial | — | 71.1 | (100)% |\n| Total | $7,938.3 | $7,826.9 | 1% |\n",
