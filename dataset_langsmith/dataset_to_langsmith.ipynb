The increase in sales volumes was a result of brand renovation and innovation launches. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2017, as favorability in both net pricing and mix offset continued investment in retailer marketing to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business contributed $21.3 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2018.

Results reflected a decrease in volumes of approximately 2% in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior-year period, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The decrease in sales volumes reflected a reduction in promotional intensity, planned discontinuation of certain lower-performing products, retailer inventory reductions, which were higher than anticipated, and deliberate actions to optimize distribution on certain lower-margin products, consistent with the Company's value over volume strategy. Price/ mix was flat compared to the prior-year period as favorable mix improvements from recent innovation and higher net pricing nearly offset continued investments in retailer marketing to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial. The acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC contributed $68.1 million to Grocery & Snacks net sales during fiscal 2018.

       "  'context': \"Grocery & Snacks operating profit for fiscal 2018 was $724.8 million, an increase of $69.4 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profits were $21.9 million lower in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017. The lower gross profit was driven by investments with retailers (i.e., trade spending reflected as a reduction of net sales), as well as higher input costs and transportation expenses, partially offset by supply chain realized productivity. The Frontera acquisition, Thanasi acquisition, and the acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which occurred in September 2016, April 2017, and October 2017, respectively, contributed $47.4 million to Grocery & Snacks gross profit during fiscal 2018 through the one-year anniversaries of the acquisitions (if reached). Advertising and promotion expenses for fiscal 2018 decreased by $19.5 million compared to fiscal 2017. Operating profit of the Grocery & Snacks segment was impacted by charges totaling $4.0 million in fiscal 2018 for the impairment of our HK Anderson® , Red Fork® , and Salpica® brand assets and $68.3 million in fiscal 2017 primarily for the impairment of our Chef Boyardee® brand asset. Grocery & Snacks also incurred $11.4 million of expenses in fiscal 2018 related to acquisitions and divestitures, charges of $31.4 million in fiscal 2017 related to the pending divestiture of the Wesson® oil business, and charges of $14.1 million and $23.6 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\\n\\n| ($ in millions) |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Reporting Segment | Fiscal 2018 Operating Profit | Fiscal 2017 Operating Profit | % Inc (Dec) |\\n| Grocery & Snacks | $724.8 | $655.4 | 11% |\\n| Refrigerated & Frozen | 479.4 | 445.8 | 8% |\\n| International | 86.5 | (168.9) | N/A |\\n| Foodservice | 121.8 | 105.1 | 16% |\\n| Commercial | - | 202.6 | (100)% |\\n\"},\n",
