       "  'context': 'The following table summarizes our consolidated cash and cash equivalents provided by (used for) operating, financing and investing activities for the periods presented:\\n\\nOperating Cash Flows\\n\\nOur consolidated net cash flow from operating activities fluctuates primarily as a result of changes in vessel utilization and TCE rates, changes in interest rates, fluctuations in working capital balances, the timing and amount of dry-docking expenditures, repairs and maintenance activities, vessel additions and dispositions, and foreign currency rates. Our exposure to the spot tanker market has contributed significantly to fluctuations in operating cash flows historically as a result of highly cyclical spot tanker rates.\\n\\nIn addition, the production performance of certain of our FPSO units that operate under contracts with a production-based compensation component has contributed to fluctuations in operating cash flows. As the charter contracts of some of our FPSO units include incentives based on average annual oil prices, the changes in global oil prices during recent years have also impacted our operating cash flows.\\n\\nConsolidated net cash flow from operating activities increased to $383.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $182.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a $127.2 million increase in income from operations mainly from operations (before depreciation, amortization, asset impairments, loss on sale of vessels and the amortization of in-process revenue contracts) of our businesses.\\n\\nFor further discussion of changes in income from vessel operations from our businesses, please read “Item 5 – Operating and Financial Review and Prospects: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments and Results of Operations.”\\n\\nIn addition, there was a $9.9 million increase in cash flows from changes to non-cash working capital, a $23.6 million increase in dividends received from joint ventures, and a $17.1 million increase in direct financing lease payments received, which are presented as an operating cash inflow instead of an investing cash inflow after the adoption of ASU 2016-02 in 2019.\\n\\nFurthermore, interest expense, including realized losses on interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, decreased a net amount of $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in realized losses on cross currency swaps. These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash outflows of $15.9 million in dry-dock expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018.\\n\\nFinancing Cash Flows\\n\\nThe Daughter Entities hold all of our liquefied gas carriers (Teekay LNG) and all of our conventional tanker assets (Teekay Tankers). Teekay LNG received $317.8 million of net proceeds from the sale-leaseback financing transactions for the Yamal Spirit and Torben Spirit for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $370.1 million from the sale-leaseback financing transactions completed for the Magdala, Myrina and Megara for the same period in 2018.\\n\\nTeekay Tankers received $63.7 million from the sale-leaseback financing transactions completed on two of its Suezmax tankers for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $241.3 million in the same period last year from the sale-leaseback financing transactions completed on eight Aframax tankers, one Suezmax tanker and one LR2 Product tanker.\\n\\nWe use our credit facilities to partially finance capital expenditures. Occasionally, we will use revolving credit facilities to finance these expenditures until longer-term financing is obtained, at which time we typically use all or a portion of the proceeds from the longer-term financings to prepay outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facilities. We actively manage the maturity profile of our outstanding financing arrangements.\\n\\nDuring 2019, we had a net cash outflow of $227.3 million relating primarily to prepayments of short-term and long-term debt, issuance costs and payments on maturity of cross currency swaps, net of proceeds from the issuances of short-term and long-term debt, compared to net cash inflow of $553.7 million in 2018. Scheduled repayments decreased by $438.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018.\\n\\nHistorically, the Daughter Entities have distributed operating cash flows to their owners in the form of distributions or dividends. There were no equity financing transactions from the Daughter Entities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Teekay LNG repurchased $25.7 million of common units in the year ended December 31, 2019.\\n\\nTeekay Parent did not raise capital through equity financing transactions in December 31, 2019, compared to $103.7 million raised in 2018 from issuances of new equity to the public, thirdparty investors and two entities established by our founder (including Resolute, our largest shareholder). Cash dividends paid decreased by $16.6 million in 2019, as a result of the elimination of Teekay Parent\\'s quarterly dividend on Teekay’s common stock commencing with the quarter ended March 31, 2019.\\n\\nInvesting Cash Flows\\n\\nDuring 2019, we received $100 million from Brookfield for the sale of our remaining interests in Altera (please read \"Item 18 – Financial Statements: Note 4 – Deconsolidation and Sale of Altera\"). We incurred capital expenditures for vessels and equipment of $109.5 million primarily for capitalized vessel modifications and shipyard construction installment payments in Teekay LNG.\\n\\nTeekay LNG received proceeds of $11.5 million from the sale of the Alexander Spirit and contributed $72.4 million to its equity-accounted joint ventures and loans to joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily to fund project expenditures in the Yamal LNG Joint Venture and the Bahrain LNG Joint Venture. During 2019, Teekay Tankers received proceeds of $19.6 million related to the sale of one Suezmax tanker.\\n\\nDuring 2018, we incurred capital expenditures for vessels and equipment of $0.7 billion, primarily for capitalized vessel modifications and shipyard construction installment payments. Teekay Parent advanced $25.0 million to Altera in the form of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\\n\\nTeekay LNG received proceeds of $54.4 million from the sale of Teekay LNG\\'s 50% ownership interest in the Excelsior Joint Venture and $28.5 million from the sales of the European Spirit and African Spirit. Teekay LNG contributed $40.5 million to its equityaccounted joint ventures and loans to joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily to fund project expenditures in the Yamal LNG Joint Venture, the Bahrain LNG project, and the Pan Union Joint Venture, and for working capital requirements for the MALT Joint Venture.\\n\\nTeekay incurred a net $25.3 million cash outflow as a result of the 2017 Brookfield Transaction (please read \"Item 18 – Financial Statements: Note 4 – Deconsolidation and Sale of Altera\").\\n\\n| (in thousands of U.S. Dollars) | Year Ended December 31, |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2019 | 2018 |\\n| Net operating cash flows | 383,306 | 182,135 |\\n| Net financing cash flows | (382,229) | 434,786 |\\n| Net investing cash flows | (50,391) | (663,456) |\\n'},\n",

Occasionally, we will use revolving credit facilities to finance these expenditures until longer-term financing is obtained, at which time we typically use all or a portion of the proceeds from the longer-term financings to prepay outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facilities. We actively manage the maturity profile of our outstanding financing arrangements.\\n\\nDuring 2019, we had a net cash outflow of $227.3 million relating primarily to prepayments of short-term and long-term debt, issuance costs and payments on maturity of cross currency swaps, net of proceeds from the issuances of short-term and long-term debt, compared to net cash inflow of $553.7 million in 2018.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had an average of 26.0 ships operating in our owned and bareboat fleet (including ships owned by the Partnership), having 9,030 revenue operating days and an average of 25.5 ships operating under our technical management (including 25.0 of our owned and bareboat ships).\\n\\nRevenues: Revenues increased by 8.1%, or $50.3 million, from $618.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $668.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenues is mainly attributable to an increase of $63.4 million deriving from the full operation of the GasLog Houston, the GasLog Hong Kong and the GasLog Gladstone which were delivered on January 8, 2018, March 20, 2018 and March 29, 2018, respectively and the deliveries of the GasLog Gladstone on March 15, 2019 and the GasLog Warsaw on July 31, 2019.

The Initial Term Loan has a term of seven years and will mature on May 12, 2024, at which time all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Initial Term Loan must be repaid.

       "  'context': 'COST OF SALES\\n\\nCost of sales consists of costs directly related to producing, processing and packing shell eggs, purchases of shell eggs\\nfrom outside producers, processing and packing of liquid and frozen egg products and other non-egg costs. Farm\\nproduction costs are those costs incurred at the egg production facility, including feed, facility, hen amortization, and\\nother related farm production costs. The following table presents the key variables affecting our cost of sales:\\n\\nCost of sales for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 was $1,138.3 million, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 0.3%, compared to $1,141.9 million for fiscal 2018. Comparing fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018, average cost per dozen purchased from outside shell egg producers decreased while cost of feed ingredients and dozens produced increased. For the 2019 fiscal year we produced 84.4% of the eggs sold by us, as compared to 84.2% for the previous year. Feed cost for fiscal 2019 was $0.415 per dozen, compared to $0.394 per dozen for the prior fiscal year, an increase of 5.3%. The increase in feed costs was primarily related to less favorable crop conditions in the south central U. S., which resulted in higher ingredient prices at some of our larger feed mill operations. The increase in feed cost per dozen resulted in an increase in cost of sales of $18.4 million for fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.\\n\\nFor the thirteen weeks ended June 1, 2019, compared to the thirteen weeks ended June 2, 2018, cost of sales decreased $34.1 million, or 11.3%, from $301.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, to $267.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Average cost per dozen purchased from outside shell egg producers decreased 42.3% due to significantly lower egg selling prices in the quarter. Feed cost per dozen for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.411, compared to $0.416 for the same quarter of fiscal 2018, a decrease of 1.2%.\\n\\nGross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 16.4% for fiscal 2019, compared to 24.0% for fiscal 2018.

Adjusted EBITDA also includes rent paid in the period related to locations that are accounted for as build-to-suit facilities.\\n\\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations and facilitates comparisons with our peer companies, many of which use a similar non-GAAP financial measure to supplement their GAAP results.\\n\\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance, and for establishing incentive compensation metrics for executives and other senior employees.\\n\\nWe do not place undue reliance on Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered as a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.

       "  'context': \"Charters-in\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had commitments to charter-in 11 vessels, which are all bareboat charters. During the second quarter of 2019, the Company commenced a bareboat charter for the Overseas Key West for a lease term of 10 years. Based on the length of the lease term and the remaining economic life of the vessel, it is accounted for as a finance lease. The remaining 10 chartered-in vessels are accounted for as operating leases.\\n\\nThe right-of-use asset accounted for as a finance lease arrangement is reported in vessels and other property, less accumulated depreciation on our consolidated balance sheets. The Company holds options for 10 of the vessels chartered-in that can be exercised for one, three or five years with the one-year option only usable once, while the three- and five-year options are available indefinitely.\\n\\nThe lease payments for the charters-in are fixed throughout the option periods and the options are on a vessel-by-vessel basis that can be exercised individually. The Company exercised its option on one of its vessels to extend the term until June 2025. On December 10, 2018, the Company exercised its options to extend the terms of the other nine vessels.\\n\\nTerms for five of the vessels were extended for an additional three years, with terms ending in December 2022, and terms for four of the vessels were extended for an additional year, with terms ending December 2020. On December 11, 2019, the terms for the four vessels ending December 2020 were extended for an additional three years, with terms ending in December 2023.\\n\\nFive of the Company's chartered in vessels contain a deferred payment obligation (“DPO”) which relates to charter hire expense incurred by the Company in prior years and payable to the vessel owner in future periods.

Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization expenses to net income.\\n\\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, as well as the effect of special items. We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance.\\n\\nWe believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. See “Special Items” for additional information.\\n\\nIt is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon’s GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

       "  'context': \"Results of Operations\\n\\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\\n\\nOur management reviews and analyzes several key financial measures in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and variability of our service revenue, operating results and cash flows. The following summary tables present a comparison of our results of operations with respect to certain key financial measures. The comparisons illustrated in the tables are discussed in greater detail below.\\n\\n(1) Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $994 and $895 for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\n\\n(2) Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $17,466 and $16,813 for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\n\\nService Revenue. Our service revenue increased 5.0% from 2018 to 2019. Exchange rates negatively impacted our increase in service revenue by approximately $5.3 million. All foreign currency comparisons herein reflect results for 2019 translated at the average foreign currency exchange rates for 2018. We increased our total service revenue by increasing the number of sales representatives selling our services, by expanding our network, by adding additional buildings to our network, by increasing our penetration into the buildings connected to our network and by gaining market share by offering our services at lower prices than our competitors.\\n\\nRevenue recognition standards include guidance relating to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, gross receipts taxes, Universal Service Fund fees and certain state regulatory fees. We record these taxes billed to our customers on a gross basis (as service revenue and network operations expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. The impact of these taxes including the Universal Service Fund resulted in an increase to our revenues from 2018 to 2019 of approximately $2.4 million.\\n\\nOur net-centric customers tend to purchase their service on a price per megabit basis. Our corporate customers tend to utilize a small portion of their allocated bandwidth on their connections and tend to purchase their service on a per connection basis. Revenues from our corporate and net-centric customers represented 68.4% and 31.6% of total service revenue, respectively, for 2019 and represented 64.9% and 35.1% of total service revenue, respectively, for 2018. Revenues from corporate customers increased 10.6% to $373.7 million for 2019 from $337.8 million for 2018 primarily due to an increase in our number of our corporate customers. Revenues from our net-centric customers decreased by 5.4% to $172.5 million for 2019 from $182.3 million for 2018 primarily due to an increase in our number of net-centric customers being offset by a decline in our average price per megabit. Our revenue from our net-centric customers has declined as a percentage of our total revenue and grew at a slower rate than our corporate customer revenue because net-centric customers purchase our services based upon a price per megabit basis and our average price per megabit declined by 23.9% from 2018 to 2019. Additionally, the net-centric market experiences a greater level of pricing pressure than the corporate market and net-centric customers who renew their service with us expect their renewed service to be at a lower price than their current price. We expect that our average price per megabit will continue to decline at similar rates which would result in our corporate revenues continuing to represent a greater portion of our total revenues and our net-centric revenues continuing to grow at a lower rate than our corporate revenues. Additionally, the impact of foreign exchange rates has a more significant impact on our net-centric revenues.\\n\\nOur on-net revenues increased 5.9% from 2018 to 2019. We increased the number of our on-net customer connections by 8.4% at December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018. On-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than on-net revenues primarily due to the 3.8% decline in our on-net ARPU, primarily from a decline in ARPU for our net-centric customers. ARPU is determined by dividing revenue for the period by the average customer connections for that period. Our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers is determined by dividing the aggregate monthly recurring fixed charges for those customers by the aggregate committed data rate for the same customers. The decline in on-net ARPU is partly attributed to volume and term based pricing discounts. Additionally, on-net customers who cancel their service from our installed base of customers, in general, have an ARPU that is greater than the ARPU for our new customers due to declining prices primarily for our on-net services sold to our net-centric customers. These trends resulted in the reduction to our on-net ARPU and a 23.9% decline in our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers.\\n\\nOur off-net revenues increased 2.7% from 2018 to 2019. Our off-net revenues increased as we increased the number of our off-net customer connections by 6.3% at December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018. Our off-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than our off-net revenue primarily due to the 5.0% decrease in our off-net ARPU.\\n\\nNetwork Operations Expenses. Network operations expenses include the costs of personnel associated with service delivery, network management, and customer support, network facilities costs, fiber and equipment maintenance fees, leased circuit costs, access and facilities fees paid to building owners and excise taxes billed to our customers and recorded on a gross basis. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense is included in network operations expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation. Our network operations expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased 0.1% from 2018 to 2019 as we were connected to 8.0% more customer connections and we were connected to 125 more on-net buildings as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in network operations expense is primarily attributable to an increase in costs related to our network and facilities expansion activities, the increase in our off-net revenues and the increase in taxes recorded on a gross basis partly offset by price reductions obtained in certain of our circuit costs and fewer fiber operating leases. When we provide off-net services we also assume the cost of the associated tail circuits.\\n\\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”). Our SG&A expenses, including non-cash equity- based compensation expense, increased 9.8% from 2018 to 2019. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense is included in SG&A expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation and was $17.5 million for 2019 and $16.8 million for 2018. SG&A expenses increased primarily from an increase in salaries and related costs required to support our expansion and increases in our sales efforts and an increase in our headcount. Our sales force headcount increased by 10.8% from 619 at December 31, 2018 to 686 at December 31, 2019 and our total headcount increased by 8.3% from 974 at December 31, 2018 to 1,055 at December 31, 2019.\\n\\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses. Our depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 1.2% from 2018 to 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the depreciation expense associated with the increase related to newly deployed fixed assets being offset by the decline in depreciation expense from fully depreciated fixed assets.\\n\\nGains on Equipment Transactions. We exchanged certain used network equipment and cash consideration for new network equipment resulting in gains of $1.1 million for 2019 and $1.0 million for 2018. The gains are based upon the excess of the estimated fair value of the new network equipment over the carrying amount of the returned used network equipment and the cash paid. The increase in gains from 2018 to 2019 was due to purchasing more equipment under the exchange program in 2019 than we purchased in 2018.\\n\\nInterest Expense. Interest expense results from interest incurred on our $445.0 million of senior secured notes, interest incurred on our $189.2 million of senior unsecured notes, interest on our installment payment agreement, interest on our finance lease obligations and interest incurred on our €135.0 million of 2024 Notes that we issued on June 25, 2019. Our interest expense increased by 12.5% for 2019 from 2018 primarily due to the issuance of $70.0 million of senior secured notes we issued in August 2018, the issuance of €135.0 million of senior unsecured notes we issued in June 2019 and an increase in our finance lease obligations. The 2024 Notes were issued at par for €135.0 million ($153.7 million) on June 25, 2019. The 2024 Notes were issued in Euros and are reported in our reporting currency — US Dollars. As of December 31, 2019 the 2024 Notes were valued at $151.4 million resulting in an unrealized gain on foreign exchange of $2.3 million in 2019.\\n\\nIncome Tax Expense. Our income tax expense was $15.1 million for 2019 and $12.7 million for 2018. The increase in our income tax expense was primarily related to an increase in our income before income taxes.\\n\\nBuildings On-net. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 we had a total of 2,801 and 2,676 on-net buildings connected to our network, respectively.\\n\\n|  | Year Ended December 31 | Percent Change |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2019 | 2018 | Change |\\n|  | (in thousands) |  |  |\\n| Service revenue | $546,159 | $520,193 | 5.0% |\\n| On-net revenues | 396,753 | 374,555 | 5.9% |\\n| Off-net revenues | 148,931 | 145,004 | 2.7% |\\n| Network operations expenses(1) | 219,801 | 219,526 | 0.1% |\\n| Selling, general, and administrative expenses(2) | 146,913 | 133,858 | 9.8% |\\n| Depreciation and amortization expenses | 80,247 | 81,233 | (1.2)% |\\n| Gains on equipment transactions | 1,059 | 982 | 7.8% |\\n| Interest expense | 57,453 | 51,056 | 12.5% |\\n| Income tax expense | 15,154 | 12,715 | 19.2% |\\n\"},\n",

Non-cash equity-based compensation expense is included in SG&A expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation and was $17.5 million for 2019 and $16.8 million for 2018. SG&A expenses increased primarily from an increase in salaries and related costs required to support our expansion and increases in our sales efforts and an increase in our headcount. Our sales force headcount increased by 10.8% from 619 at December 31, 2018 to 686 at December 31, 2019 and our total headcount increased by 8.3% from 974 at December 31, 2018 to 1,055 at December 31, 2019.\\n\\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses. Our depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 1.2% from 2018 to 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the depreciation expense associated with the increase related to newly deployed fixed assets being offset by the decline in depreciation expense from fully depreciated fixed assets.\\n\\nGains on Equipment Transactions. We exchanged certain used network equipment and cash consideration for new network equipment resulting in gains of $1.1 million for 2019 and $1.0 million for 2018. The gains are based upon the excess of the estimated fair value of the new network equipment over the carrying amount of the returned used network equipment and the cash paid. The increase in gains from 2018 to 2019 was due to purchasing more equipment under the exchange program in 2019 than we purchased in 2018.\\n\\nInterest Expense. Interest expense results from interest incurred on our $445.0 million of senior secured notes, interest incurred on our $189.2 million of senior unsecured notes, interest on our installment payment agreement, interest on our finance lease obligations and interest incurred on our €135.0 million of 2024 Notes that we issued on June 25, 2019. Our interest expense increased by 12.5% for 2019 from 2018 primarily due to the issuance of $70.0 million of senior secured notes we issued in August 2018, the issuance of €135.0 million of senior unsecured notes we issued in June 2019 and an increase in our finance lease obligations. The 2024 Notes were issued at par for €135.0 million ($153.7 million) on June 25, 2019. The 2024 Notes were issued in Euros and are reported in our reporting currency — US Dollars. As of December 31, 2019 the 2024 Notes were valued at $151.4 million resulting in an unrealized gain on foreign exchange of $2.3 million in 2019.\\n\\nIncome Tax Expense. Our income tax expense was $15.1 million for 2019 and $12.7 million for 2018. The increase in our income tax expense was primarily related to an increase in our income before income taxes.\\n\\nBuildings On-net.

       "  'context': \"Results of Operations\\n\\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\\n\\nOur management reviews and analyzes several key financial measures in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and variability of our service revenue, operating results and cash flows. The following summary tables present a comparison of our results of operations with respect to certain key financial measures. The comparisons illustrated in the tables are discussed in greater detail below.\\n\\n(1) Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $994 and $895 for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\n\\n(2) Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $17,466 and $16,813 for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\n\\nService Revenue. Our service revenue increased 5.0% from 2018 to 2019. Exchange rates negatively impacted our increase in service revenue by approximately $5.3 million. All foreign currency comparisons herein reflect results for 2019 translated at the average foreign currency exchange rates for 2018. We increased our total service revenue by increasing the number of sales representatives selling our services, by expanding our network, by adding additional buildings to our network, by increasing our penetration into the buildings connected to our network and by gaining market share by offering our services at lower prices than our competitors.\\n\\nRevenue recognition standards include guidance relating to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, gross receipts taxes, Universal Service Fund fees and certain state regulatory fees. We record these taxes billed to our customers on a gross basis (as service revenue and network operations expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. The impact of these taxes including the Universal Service Fund resulted in an increase to our revenues from 2018 to 2019 of approximately $2.4 million.\\n\\nOur net-centric customers tend to purchase their service on a price per megabit basis. Our corporate customers tend to utilize a small portion of their allocated bandwidth on their connections and tend to purchase their service on a per connection basis. Revenues from our corporate and net-centric customers represented 68.4% and 31.6% of total service revenue, respectively, for 2019 and represented 64.9% and 35.1% of total service revenue, respectively, for 2018. Revenues from corporate customers increased 10.6% to $373.7 million for 2019 from $337.8 million for 2018 primarily due to an increase in our number of our corporate customers. Revenues from our net-centric customers decreased by 5.4% to $172.5 million for 2019 from $182.3 million for 2018 primarily due to an increase in our number of net-centric customers being offset by a decline in our average price per megabit. Our revenue from our net-centric customers has declined as a percentage of our total revenue and grew at a slower rate than our corporate customer revenue because net-centric customers purchase our services based upon a price per megabit basis and our average price per megabit declined by 23.9% from 2018 to 2019. Additionally, the net-centric market experiences a greater level of pricing pressure than the corporate market and net-centric customers who renew their service with us expect their renewed service to be at a lower price than their current price. We expect that our average price per megabit will continue to decline at similar rates which would result in our corporate revenues continuing to represent a greater portion of our total revenues and our net-centric revenues continuing to grow at a lower rate than our corporate revenues. Additionally, the impact of foreign exchange rates has a more significant impact on our net-centric revenues.\\n\\nOur on-net revenues increased 5.9% from 2018 to 2019. We increased the number of our on-net customer connections by 8.4% at December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018. On-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than on-net revenues primarily due to the 3.8% decline in our on-net ARPU, primarily from a decline in ARPU for our net-centric customers. ARPU is determined by dividing revenue for the period by the average customer connections for that period. Our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers is determined by dividing the aggregate monthly recurring fixed charges for those customers by the aggregate committed data rate for the same customers. The decline in on-net ARPU is partly attributed to volume and term based pricing discounts. Additionally, on-net customers who cancel their service from our installed base of customers, in general, have an ARPU that is greater than the ARPU for our new customers due to declining prices primarily for our on-net services sold to our net-centric customers. These trends resulted in the reduction to our on-net ARPU and a 23.9% decline in our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers.\\n\\nOur off-net revenues increased 2.7% from 2018 to 2019. Our off-net revenues increased as we increased the number of our off-net customer connections by 6.3% at December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018. Our off-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than our off-net revenue primarily due to the 5.0% decrease in our off-net ARPU.\\n\\nNetwork Operations Expenses. Network operations expenses include the costs of personnel associated with service delivery, network management, and customer support, network facilities costs, fiber and equipment maintenance fees, leased circuit costs, access and facilities fees paid to building owners and excise taxes billed to our customers and recorded on a gross basis. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense is included in network operations expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation. Our network operations expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased 0.1% from 2018 to 2019 as we were connected to 8.0% more customer connections and we were connected to 125 more on-net buildings as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in network operations expense is primarily attributable to an increase in costs related to our network and facilities expansion activities, the increase in our off-net revenues and the increase in taxes recorded on a gross basis partly offset by price reductions obtained in certain of our circuit costs and fewer fiber operating leases. When we provide off-net services we also assume the cost of the associated tail circuits.\\n\\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”). Our SG&A expenses, including non-cash equity- based compensation expense, increased 9.8% from 2018 to 2019. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense is included in SG&A expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation and was $17.5 million for 2019 and $16.8 million for 2018. SG&A expenses increased primarily from an increase in salaries and related costs required to support our expansion and increases in our sales efforts and an increase in our headcount. Our sales force headcount increased by 10.8% from 619 at December 31, 2018 to 686 at December 31, 2019 and our total headcount increased by 8.3% from 974 at December 31, 2018 to 1,055 at December 31, 2019.\\n\\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses.

The debt discount on the new 2017 Junior Convertible Debt was the difference between the par value and the fair value of the debt resulting in a debt discount of $55.1 million which will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the debt.\\n\\nIn February 2017, the Company issued the 2017 Senior Convertible Debt and 2017 Junior Convertible Debt for net proceeds of $2.04 billion and $567.7 million, respectively. In connection with the issuance of these instruments, the Company incurred issuance costs of $33.7 million, of which $17.8 million and $3.4 million was recorded as convertible debt issuance costs related to the 2017 Senior Convertible Debt and 2017 Junior Convertible Debt, respectively, and will be amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the debt. The balance of $12.5 million in fees was recorded to equity. Interest on both instruments is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year.\\n\\nIn February 2015, the Company issued the 2015 Senior Convertible Debt for net proceeds of approximately $1.69 billion. In connection with the issuance, the Company incurred issuance costs of $30.3 million, of which $20.4 million was recorded as debt issuance costs and will be amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the debt. The balance of $9.9 million was recorded to equity.\\n\\nThe Company utilized the proceeds from the issuances of the 2017 Senior Convertible Debt, 2017 Junior Convertible Debt, and 2015 Senior Convertible Debt to reduce amounts borrowed under its Credit Facility and to settle a portion of the 2007 Junior Convertible Debt in privately negotiated transactions. In February 2017 and February 2015, the Company settled $431.3 million and $575.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal of its 2007 Junior Convertible Debt. The February 2015 repurchase consisted solely of cash. In February 2017, the Company used cash of $431.3 million and an aggregate of 12.0 million in shares of the Company's common stock valued at $862.7 million for total consideration of $1.29 billion to repurchase $431.3 million of the 2007 Junior Convertible Debt, of which $188.0 million was allocated to the liability component and $1.11 billion was allocated to the equity component. In addition, in February 2017, there was an inducement fee of $5.0 million which was recorded in the consolidated statements of income in loss on settlement of debt. The consideration transferred in February 2015 was $1.13 billion, of which $238.3 million was allocated to the liability component and $896.3 million was allocated to the equity component. In the case of both settlements of the 2007 Junior Convertible Debt, the consideration was allocated to the liability and equity components using the equivalent rate that reflected the borrowing rate for a similar nonconvertible debt prior to the retirement. The transactions resulted in a loss on settlement of debt of approximately $43.9 million and $50.6 million in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2015, respectively, which represented, in each case, the difference between the fair value of the liability component at time of repurchase and the sum of the carrying values of the debt component and any unamortized debt issuance costs.\\n\\n|  |  | Year Ended March 31, |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |\\n| Debt issuance amortization | $12.9 | $3.1 | $2.4 |\\n| Debt discount amortization | 2.2 | — | — |\\n| Interest expense | 291.8 | 6.6 | 40.4 |\\n| Total interest expense on Senior Secured Indebtedness | 306.9 | 9.7 | 42.8 |\\n| Debt issuance amortization | 3.6 | 3.5 | 2.1 |\\n| Debt discount amortization | 112.4 | 106.1 | 56.1 |\\n| Coupon interest expense | 77.1 | 77.3 | 44.5 |\\n| Total interest expense on Convertible Debt | 193.1 | 186.9 | 102.7 |\\n| Other interest expense | 2.9 | 2.4 | 0.8 |\\n| Total interest expense | $502.9 | $199.0 | $146.3 |\\n\"},\n",

The emphasis remained on effective resource allocation and careful cost management. The overall investment in product development was maintained, with continuing focus on high-growth, high-margin areas. Investment in the sales and marketing organisation was targeted on expanding our key account management programme to drive incremental business with our most valuable customers and developing routes to market for our new technologies to a broadening customer base. Administration costs in 2019 reflected an inflationary increase and higher corporate costs, primarily due to CEO transition.\\n\\nSegmentally, investment continued in Networks & Security, where we see the most near-term opportunities for growth, particularly in relation to 400G high-speed Ethernet and our Positioning business. A new General Manager joined Lifecycle Service Assurance in October and a review is in progress to evolve the business and optimise the organisational structure to expand the customer base and deliver on our growth agenda.

Future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based compensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others.\\n\\nProvision for income taxes decreased in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the absence of the initial accounting charges related to the Tax Act that were recorded in fiscal 2018. To a lesser extent, provision for income taxes also decreased in fiscal 2019 due to the net favorable impacts of our final accounting for the Tax Act in fiscal 2019; the net favorable impacts of the Tax Act on our tax profile during fiscal 2019; the favorable impact of a tax benefit arising from an increase in a deferred tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal structure in fiscal 2019; and lower income before provision for income taxes in fiscal 2019. These decreases to our provision for income taxes in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 were partially offset both by lower excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2019, and by less favorable changes in net unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements with tax authorities and other events in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018.\\n\\n|  |  |  | Year Ended May 31, |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  |  |  | Percent Change |  |\\n| (Dollars in millions) | 2019 | Actual | Constant | 2018 |\\n| Provision for income taxes | $1,185 | -87% | -86% | $8,837 |\\n| Effective tax rate | 9.7% |  |  | 71.1% |\\n'},\n",

The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, over the net amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The interest of the non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree may initially be measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling shareholders’ proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method.

With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2015.\\n\\nDeferred income taxes have been provided by temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes. To the extent allowed by GAAP, the Company provides valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets for amounts when the realization is uncertain. Included in the balances at December 31, 2019 and 2018, are no tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.\\n\\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.

       "  'context': 'Note 7: Income Taxes\\n\\nOn December 22, 2017, the “Tax Cuts & Jobs Act” was signed into law and was effective for the Company starting in the quarter ended December 24, 2017. U.S. tax reform reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, assessed a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The impact on income taxes due to a change in legislation is required under the authoritative guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, Income Taxes, to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. In conjunction, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 118, which allowed for the recording of provisional amounts related to U.S. tax reform and subsequent adjustments related to U.S. tax reform during an up to one-year measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. The Company recorded what it believed to be reasonable estimates during the SAB 118 measurement period. During the December 2018 quarter, the Company finalized the accounting of the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform. Although the SAB 118 measurement period has ended, there may be some aspects of U.S. tax reform that remain subject to future regulations and/or notices which may further clarify certain provisions of U.S. tax reform. The Company may need to adjust its previously recorded amounts to reflect the recognition and measurement of its tax accounting positions in accordance with ASC 740; such adjustments could be material.\\n\\nThe computation of the one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings was recorded on a provisional basis in the amount of $883.0 million in the fiscal year ended June 24, 2018, as permitted under SAB 118. The Company recorded a subsequent provisional adjustment of $36.6 million, as a result of incorporating new information into the estimate, in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended September 23, 2018. The Company finalized the computation of the transition tax liability during the December 2018 quarter. The final adjustment resulted in a tax benefit of $51.2 million, which was recorded in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended December 23, 2018. The final balance of total transition tax is $868.4 million. The one-time transition tax is based on the Company’s total post-1986 earnings and profits (“E&P”) that was previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The Company had previously accrued deferred taxes on a portion of this E&P. The Company has completed the calculation of total post-1986 E&P and related income tax pools for its foreign subsidiaries. The Company elected to pay the one-time transition tax over a period of eight years.\\n\\nBeginning in fiscal year 2019, the Company is subject to the impact of the GILTI provision of U.S. tax reform. The GILTI provision imposes taxes on foreign earnings in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets. The Company has calculated the impact of the GILTI provision on current year earnings and has included the impact in the effective tax rate. The Company made an accounting policy election in the September 2018 quarter to record deferred taxes in relation to the GILTI provision, and recorded a provisional tax benefit of $48.0 million in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended September 23, 2018, under SAB 118. The Company finalized the computation of the accounting policy election during the December 2018 quarter. The final adjustment resulted in a tax expense of $0.4 million, which was recorded in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended December 23, 2018. The final tax benefit of the election is $47.6 million.\\n\\nThe components of income (loss) before income taxes were as follows:\\n\\n|  |  | YearEnded |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | June 30, 2019 | June 24, 2018 | June 25, 2017 |\\n|  |  | (in thousands) |  |\\n| United States | $(59,876) | $128,190 | $7,553 |\\n| Foreign | 2,506,447 | 3,023,599 | 1,804,120 |\\n|  | $2,446,571 | $3,151,789 | $1,811,673 |\\n'},\n",

The impact on income taxes due to a change in legislation is required under the authoritative guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, Income Taxes, to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. In conjunction, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 118, which allowed for the recording of provisional amounts related to U.S. tax reform and subsequent adjustments related to U.S. tax reform during an up to one-year measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. The Company recorded what it believed to be reasonable estimates during the SAB 118 measurement period. During the December 2018 quarter, the Company finalized the accounting of the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform. Although the SAB 118 measurement period has ended, there may be some aspects of U.S. tax reform that remain subject to future regulations and/or notices which may further clarify certain provisions of U.S. tax reform. The Company may need to adjust its previously recorded amounts to reflect the recognition and measurement of its tax accounting positions in accordance with ASC 740; such adjustments could be material.\\n\\nThe computation of the one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings was recorded on a provisional basis in the amount of $883.0 million in the fiscal year ended June 24, 2018, as permitted under SAB 118. The Company recorded a subsequent provisional adjustment of $36.6 million, as a result of incorporating new information into the estimate, in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended September 23, 2018. The Company finalized the computation of the transition tax liability during the December 2018 quarter. The final adjustment resulted in a tax benefit of $51.2 million, which was recorded in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended December 23, 2018. The final balance of total transition tax is $868.4 million. The one-time transition tax is based on the Company’s total post-1986 earnings and profits (“E&P”) that was previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The Company had previously accrued deferred taxes on a portion of this E&P. The Company has completed the calculation of total post-1986 E&P and related income tax pools for its foreign subsidiaries. The Company elected to pay the one-time transition tax over a period of eight years.\\n\\nBeginning in fiscal year 2019, the Company is subject to the impact of the GILTI provision of U.S. tax reform. The GILTI provision imposes taxes on foreign earnings in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets. The Company has calculated the impact of the GILTI provision on current year earnings and has included the impact in the effective tax rate. The Company made an accounting policy election in the September 2018 quarter to record deferred taxes in relation to the GILTI provision, and recorded a provisional tax benefit of $48.0 million in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended September 23, 2018, under SAB 118.

Since the sale of AirBars has been lower than expected, a major part of the inventory at the partner remained unused when the due date of the bank guarantee neared and Neonode therefore agreed that the partner should keep inventory for the production of 20,000 AirBars and the rest be purchased by us.
